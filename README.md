# Multiplex-SPR-Analysis
A workflow for streamlining the analysis and visualization of experimental results generated by array-based SPR equipment

The goal of this project is to create a series of tools for the handling of csv files containing surface plasmon resonance data generated by array-based instruments. All modules are designed with the outputs of Scrubber2 in mind. All work will initially be done in R, but may branch out to Python, particularly for a user interface.

Learning programming principles is at least as important as creating a useable product. Collaborators are welcome!
